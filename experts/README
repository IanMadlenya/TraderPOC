### This module will contain the expert base classes and a few dumb experts.

### Here is where I put info for ideas for experts
###

Scan DowJones data for dividend distributions, and create a dividend hound.
   Buy on dividend announcement, Sell after record date.
   Make sure that payment exceeds comission of 2 trades.
    K.I.S.S.
    

Find a favorite trader on stocktwits and follow just that person.  
 Design an expert that IS that trader, or at least what he/she provides on twitter.
  (may need to supplement with a TradingView.com API where a machine can read a chart)
